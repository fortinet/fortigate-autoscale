# FortiGate Autoscale
A collection of **Node.js** modules and cloud-specific templates which support auto scaling functionality for groups of FortiGate-VM instances on various cloud platforms.

This project contains the code and templates for the **Microsoft Azure** deployment. For deployment on other cloud platforms, visit the relevant repository:
* The **AliCloud** deployment is in the  [alicloud-autoscale](https://github.com/fortinet/alicloud-autoscale/) repository.
* The **Amazon AWS** deployment is in the [fortigate-autoscale-aws](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale-aws) repository.
* The **GCP** deployment is in the [fortigate-autoscale-gcp](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale-gcp) repository.

This project is organized in separate node modules:

 * [fortigate-autoscale/core](core) contains the core logic and provides an interface that can be extended to deal with the differences in cloud platform APIs.
 * [fortigate-autoscale/azure](azure) contains an implementation for the **Microsoft Azure** platform API and **Cosmos DB** storage backend.

The project also contains a deployment script that can generate packages for each cloud service's *serverless* implementation.

## Supported platforms
This project supports auto scaling for the **Microsoft Azure** cloud platform.

## Deployment packages
 To generate local deployment packages:

  1. From the [project release page](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale/releases), download the source code (.zip or .tar.gz) for the latest 2.0 version.
  2. Extract the source code.
  3. Run `npm run build` at the project root directory.

Deployment packages as well as source code will be available in the **dist** directory.
