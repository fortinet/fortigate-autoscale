# FortiGate Autoscale for Azure

A collection of **Node.js** modules and cloud-specific templates which support auto scaling functionality for groups of FortiGate-VM instances on various cloud platforms.

This project contains the code and templates for the **Microsoft Azure** deployment. For deployment on other cloud platforms, visit the relevant repository:
* The **AliCloud** deployment is in the  [alicloud-autoscale](https://github.com/fortinet/alicloud-autoscale/) repository.
* The **Amazon AWS** deployment is in the [fortigate-autoscale-aws](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale-aws) repository.
* The **GCP** deployment is in the [fortigate-autoscale-gcp](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale-gcp) repository.

This project is organized in separate node modules:

 * [fortigate-autoscale/core](core) contains the core logic and provides an interface that can be extended to deal with the differences in cloud platform APIs.
 * [fortigate-autoscale/azure](azure) contains an implementation for the **Microsoft Azure** platform API and **Cosmos DB** storage backend.

The project also contains a deployment script that can generate packages for each cloud service's *serverless* implementation.

## Deployment packages

# Launch a demo
FortiGate Autoscale for Azure requires the deployment of two templates in sequence into the same resource group.
| Step | Action |
|------|---------------|
| 1 | Deploy the stage 1 template using the [deployment parameters file](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale/blob/main/azure_template_deployment/templates/deploy_fortigate_autoscale.hybrid_licensing.params.json).<br><a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Ffortinet%2Ffortigate-autoscale%2Fmaster%2Fazure_template_deployment%2Ftemplates%2Fdeploy_fortigate_autoscale.hybrid_licensing.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/></a> |
| 2 | Wait for the stage 1 deployment to complete. |
| 3 | Deploy the stage 2 template using the same [deployment parameters file](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale/blob/main/azure_template_deployment/templates/deploy_fortigate_autoscale.hybrid_licensing.params.json) with the same parameter values used in step 1.<br><a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Ffortinet%2Ffortigate-autoscale%2Fmaster%2Fazure_template_deployment%2Ftemplates%2Fdeploy_fortigate_autoscale.hybrid_licensing.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/></a> |

Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.fortinet.com/vm/azure/fortigate/6.4/azure-cookbook/6.4.0/161167/deploying-auto-scaling-on-azure) for descriptions of the deployment parameters file.
