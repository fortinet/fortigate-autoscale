# FortiGate Autoscale - Core

`fortigate-autoscale/core` contains the core logic used to handle autoscaling groups for various cloud platforms.

The design metaphor for `fortigate-autoscale/core` is an API sandwich with cloud-specific layers on the outside and core functionality in the middle. Leveraging this API requires extending the following classes:

* `AutoscaleHandler` is a _base_ class which handles the core logic. This class should be extended to handle events invoked by each cloud platform.

* `CloudPlatform` is an _abstract_ class which implements cloud API functionality for each cloud. This class should be extended with methods implemented as needed for the platform.

There is also a container class `LifecycleItem` which is currently used only by AWS. This class serves as a common container for Lifecycle event data.
